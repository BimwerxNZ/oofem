/**
 * Abstract base class for all lattice "structural" constitutive models. It declares common  services provided
 * by all lattice structural material models. The implementation of these services is partly left on derived classes,
 * which will implement constitutive model dependent part.
 * Some general purpose services are implemented on this level. For details, how to store
 * material model related history variables in integration points, see base class @ref Material documentation.
 *
 * The constitutive model can in general support several material modes (plane stress, plane strain ,... modes).
 * Its capabilities can be examined using hasMaterialModeCapability  service.
 * It is generally assumed, that results obtained from constitutive model services are according to
 * valid material mode. This mode is determined from integration point, which is compulsory parameter of all material
 * services.
 * Structural material introduces several stress/strain modes.
 * Full and reduced formats of stress/strain vectors are introduced for convenience.
 * The full format includes all components, even if they are zero due to stress/strain mode nature,
 * but in the reduced format, only generally nonzero components are stored.
 * (full format must used only if absolutely necessary, to avoid wasting of space. It is used
 * by output routines to print results in general form). Methods for converting vectors between
 * full and reduced format are provided.
 *
 * If in particular mode particular stress component is zero, the corresponding strain is not computed
 * and not stored in reduced vector, and in full vector there is zero value on corresponding position.
 * On the other hand, if some zero strain is imposed,
 * On the other hand, if zero strain component is imposed this condition must be taken into account in geometrical
 * relations (at element level), and corresponding component are included stress/strain reduced vectors.
 *
 * Structural material introduces following basic stress/strain modes
 * - 3d state - all components of general stress/strain vector are generally nonzero.
 *   General 3d strain vector has following components {sig_xx, sig_yy, sig_zz, tau_yz, tau_xz, tau_xy}
 * - plane stress - sig_zz = tau_yz =  tau_xz = 0.
 * - plane strain - eps_z = gamma_xz = gamma_yz = 0.
 *   Note: as already described, if zero strain component is imposed
 *   (Plane strain, ..) this condition must be taken into account in geometrical
 *   relations, and corresponding component has to be included in reduced vector.
 * - 1d uniaxial state - sigma_y = sigma_z = tau_yz = tau_zx = tau_xy  = 0.
 * - 2d beam layer - sigma_y=sigma_z=tau_zy=tau_xy = 0.
 * - 3d shell layer, 2d plate layer - sigma_z = 0.
 *
 * Derived classes can of course extend those modes.
 * Generally speaking, there are following major tasks, covered by declared services.
 * - Computing real/second PK stress vector (tensor) at integration point for given strain increment and updating its
 *   state (still temporary state, after overall equilibrium is reached).
 * - Updating its state (final state), when equilibrium has been reached.
 * - Returning its material stiffness (and/or flexibility) matrices for given material mode.
 * - Storing/restoring its context to stream.
 * - Returning its material properties.
 *
 * Structural material services should not be called directly by elements. Instead, they always should
 * pass their requests to corresponding cross section model. Cross section performs all necessary integration over
 * its volume and invokes material model services.
